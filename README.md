This research investigates the comparative efficacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) and traditional machine learning techniques (Isolation Forest) in detecting financial mismanagement within the UK National Health Service (NHS). Using a dataset of 995 NHS trust observations across five fiscal years (2017‚Äì2022) and nine confirmed cases of mismanagement, the study applies an Isolation Forest algorithm to structured financial metrics and a Google Gemini‚Äìbased LLM system to analyze unstructured audit narratives. Both approaches achieved a 66.6% pseudo-recall rate. Temporal analysis revealed performance shifts during the COVID‚Äë19 period (2020‚Äì2022), and logistic regression showed that operating margin predicts Isolation Forest flags (Œ≤ = 0.64, p = 0.017), while LLM scores are independent of traditional metrics.
